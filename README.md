My game:
My game story based on the movie called the maze runner; however in my game version, the focus will be on a single protagonist who finds themselves trapped in the maze. Unlike the movie, there will be no other individuals who are part of the experiment, and the player will have to navigate the maze alone.

In addition to navigating the maze and avoiding deadly zombies, players could have chances to collect a key, tea and found the door. The key will unlock a door that leads to the exit of the maze. As the player explores the maze, they will come across various messages that will provide them with clues and help them advance further. These messages could be the wrong information about the key, the location of true key and the location of true exist.
